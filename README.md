# CuringChamber
Curing chamber for making charcuterie.

This project started with the idea to make a whole prosciutto.  I also hunt and would like to use the venison roasts in something other than jerky.
So, I decided I needed a curing chamber and after a little research, I found that the commercial versions are expensive ($1500+).  Then I looked 
into what it takes to control temp and humidity and found there are cheap devices for this purpose but that might take the fun out of it and 
limit my remote accessibility. I decided to base my DIY system on a raspberry pi, python and version everything via github.  I had no 
experience with any of of these technologies prior to starting this project but look forward to discovery.  So far I have what I believe is a
viable python script for the use of controlling 4 relay panel that will in-turn control heater, humidifier, dehumidifier, and a wine cooler. I 
designed the PCB boards using the "Fritzing" app and exportedthe design to a company called Osh Park in california to have the boards built. 
The current boards on git are of the most recent design and have had 3 previous versions.
